## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Spotify, as one of the most well-known digital music services, is widely used by music lovers worldwide. Spotify is a powerful platform as people can find songs they want in its music library. There is no doubt that Spotify is one of the most popular music platforms all around the world.

In recent years, chat bots are becoming a popular human-computer interaction application by which people can customize their needs in an intuitive way. An increasing number of services are adding chatbot modules to improve user experience and the development of chat bot is a trend of the era.

In this project, our team managed to create a chat bot which can respond to the user's input and perform interaction with the user's Spotify account. It can help them find songs they want, play a demo, and make recommendations. Users can talk with the chatbot, ask it some questions and ask for a recommendation for music in the Spotify library based on the artist’s name, music genre or artist genre. The chatbot is also capable of obtaining a user's playlist on Spotify and making recommendations based on it. A HTML frontend is created for the chatbot and backend is built based on the Flask framework. This chatbot only considers music from 2000 to 2020 included in the Spotify music library so it is still limited to some extent. Nevertheless, it still has potential to be further developed in functions and databases.
